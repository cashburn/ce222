I'm becoming aware
 that I'm staring,
 I'm like a
 rabbit trapped in
 the blinding headlights
 of vacuous crap.
 Maybe it's the
 Hamlet she just
 mis-quothed, or the
 sixth glass of
 wine I just
 quaffed, but my
 diplomacy dike groans,
 and the asshole
 held back by
 its stones can
 be held back
 no more.
